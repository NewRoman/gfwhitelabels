        All securities-related activity is conducted by GrowthFountain Capital LLC (“GrowthFountain Capital”), an affiliate of GrowthFountain, and a registered funding portal (CRD#283380), located at 79 Madison Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10016. GrowthFountain Capital does not give investment advice or recommendations and no communication, through this website or otherwise should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on this investment platform. Investments offered under Section 4(a)(6); Regulation Crowdfunding, are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment amount should not invest through this platform. Companies seeking investments through Regulation Crowdfunding may be in earlier stages of development and their business model, products and services may not yet be fully developed, operational or tested in the marketplace. There is no guarantee that their valuation or other terms are accurate or in in line with industry valuations. Additionally, investors may receive illiquid securities that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. Investments made in companies issued under Regulation Crowdfunding should comprise a very modest component of your portfolio, and that small segment should be diversified.
