        <h1>PayBack Share Calculator - Intro</h1>
        <p>PayBack Share is a revenue share agreement that may be a good choice for:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>A) Companies that generate or expect to generate cash (your operating earnings will have to be > 5% of your revenue for this to make sense);</li>
            <li>B) LLC’s that are looking for ways to raise funds without the need to issue K-1s; and</li>
            <li>C) Companies that want to maintain a clean capital structure in anticipation of a future venture capital fundraising round.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol class="list-unstyled">
            <li>1. You share at least 5% of your revenue annually;</li>
            <li>2. No distribution is required until the second full calendar year and you are allowed one year of forbearance as needed;</li>
            <li>3. Distributions are capped at 2x the invested amount, at which point your obligation is fulfilled.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here are some of the advantages of choosing PayBack Share:</p>
        <ol class="list-unstyled">
            <li>1. It does not dilute the ownership of current shareholders or the control of management</li>
            <li>2. It avoids a prolonged negotiation over valuation and “messy cap table”</li>
            <li>3. It may be easier to raise capital and attract investors by offering the potential to earn regular cash distributions</li>
            <li>4. It gives you the chance to keep more of the upside since once investors’ have received 2x their money back, you will have no further obligation</li>
        </ol>
