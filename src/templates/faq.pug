These shares represent an ownership stake in the company. If the business is sold at some point, these shares entitle the owner to a percentage of what is earned in the sale of the business. In addition, if there is a dividend, you receive your share of the distribution. However, there is no guarantee that an investor will earn any return on their investment and investors may lose all of the money they invest. In other cases, investors may receive common shares, or convertible debt in the company. As always, it is important to read the specific offering documents related to each investment opportunity. Please review the offerings documents carefully to understand the investment. If you have questions or concerns, be sure to consult your advisors.

As an equity investor in a private company, you would receive a return on your investment if and when the company distributes money. If a private company distributes money, it typically does so in one of three ways: 1) It gets sold to another company or a new set of investors such as a private equity firm; 2) It pays a dividend; or 3) It is listed on a stock exchange such as the NYSE. The timeframe for these results, if they occur, may very easily be several years and there is no way to predict if or when you may receive a return. Private investments are risky and you should be aware that you may lose all or part of your money.
